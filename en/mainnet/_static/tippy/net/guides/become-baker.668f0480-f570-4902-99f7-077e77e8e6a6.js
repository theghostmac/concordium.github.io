The stakes of validators and delegators are updated each pay day (but the changes for each pay day are fixed one epoch before). Pay day is thus when new validators begin validation and updates to delegation and validation take effect, such as increasing stake, restaking preferences, adding delegation. In the case of decreasing stake or removing delegation or validation, there is a longer cool-down period, after which the change is executed at the <strong>next pay day after the cool-down period ends</strong>. The cool-down period is 3 weeks. Pay day is every 24 hours (i.e., 24 epochs) at approximately 09:00 UTC on Mainnet and approximately 12:00 UTC on Testnet. The list of lottery winners that are elected to be the leader for every round in that epoch is established at the beginning of the epoch.</p></dd>"}
